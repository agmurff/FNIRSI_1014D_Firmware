# BOOT_NOTES.md — boot chain, SD layout, loader contracts, and migration assessment

Consolidated from code spelunking 2026-07-09. The authoritative loader source for the
current 1014D chain is vendored at `FNIRSI_1014D_Firmware/fnirsi_1014d_startup/` (pecostm32);
the committed `fnirsi_1013d_scope/bootloader_1014d_base.bin` is a hash-verified local rebuild
of it (re-verified 2026-08-21: byte-identical to our rebuild of his source in the vendor
tree's `dist/`; NOT bit-identical to the binary pecostm32 originally committed — different
toolchain, same source).

## Boot chain on the 1014D today

1. **BROM** loads the eGON-headered SPL+loader from SD at byte offset 8192 (sector 16).
   If SD boot fails it falls back to SPI NOR — the **stock FNIRSI firmware is still in SPI
   flash**, which is the recovery of last resort.
2. **pecostm32's `fnirsi_1014d_startup`** runs: clocks → DRAM → caches → display init →
   UART1 (key controller) → FPGA init → **`fpga_check_ready()` spins until the FPGA reports
   `0x1432`** (see FPGA_NOTES.md — this happens *before* the boot menu, so a different FPGA
   version bricks everything below) → backlight on (`0x78`).
3. **Key-hold boot menu**: at power-up the key controller returns 49 when idle and **0 when
   any extra button is held**. If 0: the loader shows three choices and waits —
   **F1 = "new PECO firmware"** (SD), **F2 = "original FNIRSI firmware"** (SPI flash
   `0x27000`), **F3 = FEL mode** (jumps to BROM FEL entry `0xFFFF0020`).
   No key held → default = PECO firmware from SD.
4. Scope program is read from **SD sector 80** (eGON.EXE header checked, loaded to
   `0x80000000`, header skipped) and jumped to. Sector 80 = byte 40960 = image offset
   `0x8000` + the 8192-byte dd offset — matching the Makefile's
   `flashfilepacker … -l 0x8000` packaging.

**This loader keeps dual-boot with the stock firmware** (F2 path reads it from SPI NOR).

## There is NO persistent boot-config byte in this chain

The Atlan4/1013D loader chain has one: byte at **SD sector 710, offset 0x1F** (DRAM mirror
`0x81BFFC1F`), values 0 = PECO / 1 = FNIRSI / 2 = FEL, bit `0x04` = show menu; sector-710
checksum covers only the first words, so the byte is poke-safe. **pecostm32's 1014D loader
never reads it** — its menu is key-hold-only, nothing is persistent.

(Alignment postscript, verified 2026-08-21: the CP15 A bit is never set, so the `uint32*`
*read* at `…1F` works via the ARMv5 rotated load — but a *store* through the same pointer
lands on the whole word at `…1C`, stomping the touch X-swap config byte and zeroing `…1F`
itself, so the boot choice never round-tripped through the Atlan4-era writer anyway; the
1014D binary never even emits the access.)

Consequences in the current tree:

- The old hidden F1×2→FEL / F2→SD boot-switch (removed 2026-07-09) wrote this byte in vain;
  what "sorta worked" about it was the **watchdog reboot** — with a key held through the
  reboot, the loader's own menu appears and F1/F2/F3 picks the firmware. That capability now
  lives in the **Factory settings menu** (main menu, last item): *Restore defaults* (reset +
  save + reboot), *Reboot* (save + watchdog reset — hold a key to get the loader menu),
  *FEL firmware update* (saves config, masks IRQs, jumps straight to the BROM FEL entry
  `0xFFFF0020` — no reboot or key-hold needed, mirroring the loader's F3 path).
- If a *persistent* boot default is ever wanted, port the byte contract into
  `fnirsi_1014d_startup` (source is right there, ~20 lines) and have the factory menu write
  it (via `uint8*`, see the quirk below).
- The old workflow trick "enter FEL by poking sector-710 byte 31 (absolute byte 363551)"
  is **obsolete on this chain**. FEL entry today = Factory settings → FEL, or hold a key at
  power-on → F3.

## SD sector map (as used by this tree)

| Sector | Contents | Reader/writer |
|---|---|---|
| 16 (byte 8192) | SPL + loader image (dd target `seek=8 bs=1024`) | BROM |
| 80 (image offset 0x8000) | scope program, eGON.EXE header | `fnirsi_1014d_startup` |
| 708 | input calibration data | `scope_load/save_input_calibration_data()` |
| 709 | scope settings (checksummed blob) | `scope_load/save_configuration_data()` (save fires on the key controller's OFF code) |
| 710 | display config: magic words `AAAAAAAA/55555555` (0,1), TCON timing (2,3), magic `CCCCCCCC/33333333` (4,5), checksum of words 0–5 (6); byte 0x1F = legacy boot-choice byte | per-chain (row corrected 2026-08-21) — 1013D chain: loader reads it into DRAM, `scope_reset_config_data()` writes it; 1014D chain: nobody reads it from SD (`display_control.c` validates only the never-populated DRAM mirror), the write is `#if !PORT_1014D`-guarded, and the sm boot-switch writer was removed 2026-07-09 |

Both pecostm32's startup and the scope's `display_control.c` **validate the magic words and
fall back to hardcoded panel timing** (`0x041E0044` / `0x041A0017`) when invalid — that is
why the 1014D panel works even though nothing in this chain populates the DRAM staging block.

## Known wart: sector-710 garbage writes on the 1014D

`scope_reset_config_data()` (runs on first boot / corrupted settings, and now from the
factory menu's Restore defaults) sets the boot word to "4 = PECO + menu" and used to write
**sector 710 from the DRAM staging block `0x81BFFC00`** — which on the 1014D chain is never
populated, so uninitialized DRAM landed in the sector. **That write is now `#if !PORT_1014D`
guarded** (2026-07-09); re-enable it only when something populates/validates the staging
block (e.g. a loader that loads sector 710 like the 1013D chain did).

Related quirk: `STARTUP_CONFIG_ADDRESS` is declared `uint32*` at the **unaligned** address
`0x…1F`. On ARMv5, `LDR` from it rotates the aligned word so reads *do* see byte 0x1F in the
LSB, but `STR` stores to the aligned address `0x…1C` — read and write paths are asymmetric at
machine level. If the byte contract is ever ported to the 1014D loader, redeclare it `uint8*`.

## Self-update / recovery paths (no card swapping)

- **USB mass storage** exposes the raw card from sector 0 → from a host,
  `dd if=fnirsi_1013d.bin of=<usb-disk> bs=1024 seek=8` re-flashes the whole boot image.
- **FEL**: hold a key at power-on → F3, then
  `sunxi-fel -p write 0x7FFFFFE0 fnirsi_1013d_scope.bin exe 0x80000000` (unpacked scope bin).
- Last resort: remove SD → BROM boots the stock firmware from SPI NOR.

## Atlan4's bootloader source (partial) — lineage confirmed

`Bootloader fw0.02 and fw0.03 and fw0.04/` at the repo root (user-extracted from the Atlan4
GitHub zip, 2026-07-09) contains full snapshots whose folder names say it all: *"fw0.0x
modify **1014d startup** for 1013d"* — **Atlan4's 1013D bootloaders are pecostm32's
`fnirsi_1014d_startup` adapted for the 1013D.** What their fw0.04 adds over our vendored
1014D loader (all in its `fnirsi_1014d_startup.c`):

- reads **sector 710 into DRAM `0x81BFFC00`** at boot (this is what populates the staging
  block on the 1013D chain);
- `STARTUP_CONFIG_ADDRESS` as **`uint8*`** at `0x81BFFC1F` (they fixed the alignment quirk —
  note the *scope-side* Atlan4 code still uses `uint32*`, so their scope's `ptr[0] = 4` write
  actually lands on the aligned word at `0x…1C`; more evidence the quirk is real);
- boot choice from that byte: `>3` ⇒ show menu, else `& 0x03` picks PECO(0)/FNIRSI(1)/FEL(2);
- a **touch-driven** menu (GT911 init + touch boxes) in place of the key menu.

The **shipped** Atlan4 loader binary is believed to be fw0.08; its source is not in the zip
(gap — possibly never published or in another snapshot). For porting the byte contract into
our key-driven loader, fw0.04 is a complete reference: take the sector-710 load + `uint8*`
byte handling, keep UART keys instead of touch.

## Bootloader v0.8 = our `bootloader_base.bin` — and its FPGA wait is dead code

Findings 2026-07-10 (Atlan4 repo probed via GitHub tree API + selective raw fetches, no
clone):

- The committed **1013D-variant loader `fnirsi_1013d_scope/bootloader_base.bin`** (from the
  Atlan4 v1.00o5 dist) **is bootloader v0.8**: strings include "BOOT fw v0.8",
  "PECO firmware", "FNIRSI firmware", "Start FEL mode". The FPGA readmes' *"IMPORTANT:
  Install frst bootloader v0.8 or higer"* requirement is therefore already satisfied
  in-tree for the 1013D chain — nothing left to hunt down.
- **Why v0.8 is the requirement**: full disassembly (`arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -b binary
  -marm`) shows v0.8 still *contains* two `fpga_check_ready()`-style routines (read the
  version via cmd `0x06`, compare against a `0x1432` literal, infinite retry with a
  1000-cycle delay — at file offset ~`0x1340` in the SPL and ~`0x125dc` in the main stage),
  but **neither has a single call site** — a caller search over the whole image finds
  branches only to adjacent FPGA functions (e.g. `bl 0x126a4`, the cmd-`0x04` enable).
  The wait is compiled in but never called: **v0.8 boots regardless of the FPGA version
  word**, which is exactly what a 0x1532/0x1632 replacement bitstream needs.
  *Re-verified 2026-08-21 (independent re-disassembly): both routines reproduced at
  `0x1340`/`0x125dc`, both `0x1432` literals located, zero call sites, no pointer
  references — CONFIRMED.* Earlier
  loaders (fw0.02–0.04, and pecostm32's `fnirsi_1014d_startup`) call it live and hang
  before their boot menus.
- **Our 1014D chain is NOT covered**: `bootloader_1014d_base.bin` (pecostm32's startup)
  has the live wait. Patch + rebuild before any new bitstream (item 1 below).
- Atlan4's repo also carries a **`bootloader v0.7.bin`** under
  `Guide to firmware/firmware_Atlan_Peco/` (binary only), and its migration readme
  describes the modern chain as bootloader + updater + scope ("fnirsi_1013d_migration
  v0.2.bin = bootloader v0.7, updater v0.02l, scope v0.26y2"). No v0.8 *source* exists
  anywhere in the repo — v0.8 lives only as the dist binary we already have.
- Atlan4's FPGA sources (AL3 family — correct for this unit's AL3_10) are now vendored at
  repo-root **`Atlan4-FPGA/`**; what they answer (version word 0x1532, 50 MHz refclk +
  internal PLL, stock-1013D flash dump, CH341 programming) is in FPGA_NOTES.md §migration.

## Migration assessment: "bringing the bootloader changes over"

Atlan4's newer loaders are touch-driven and the latest (fw0.08?) exists only as a binary —
both facts argue against porting their code wholesale. The sane direction remains: keep
`fnirsi_1014d_startup` (vendored source, key-driven, dual-boot) and port *features* into it,
now with fw0.04 as the worked example:

1. **Relax/remove `fpga_check_ready()`** (hard prerequisite for any new FPGA bitstream, and
   pecostm32's own comment suggests it; also makes boot faster).
2. Optionally **honor the sector-710 boot byte** so the scope-side F1×2/F2 switch becomes
   real; write it via `uint8*`, and populate/validate the staging block before persisting.
3. Keep the key-hold menu and the SPI-NOR stock fallback exactly as they are.
4. If the boot byte is adopted, also load sector 710 into `0x81BFFC00` in the loader (that's
   what the 1013D chain did) so the display-config/staging story becomes coherent again.
